# Oscar Gr - Portfolio

My personal portfolio. It is used as a digital & film photography showcase, there's nothing IT related. This repo is my work portfolio, as it uses my personal favorites modern Javacript frameworks. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

```bash
yarn
```

## Developpement

My portfolio uses [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/), I think it's where Vue is going, as it will progressively remove [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/), it's own builder that uses [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/)
 
```bash
yarn run
```

`yarn run` is an alias for `vite`

## Build & Deploy

```bash
yarn build
```
`yarn build` is an alias for `vite build`

## Future

There is still a lot to do, please check the Project page of this repo.
